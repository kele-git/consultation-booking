## Student Consultation Booking App

This application is designed to simplify the process of booking consultations between students and lecturers at our institution. Built using Flutter and powered by Firebase, it allows students to formally schedule meetings by selecting the purpose of the consultation, choosing a convenient date and time, and selecting a preferred lecturer within the faculty. Whether students need to discuss academic marks, syllabus concerns, or other issues, this app provides a streamlined and user-friendly platform to facilitate effective communication and scheduling.

Firebase is used for backend services including real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage, ensuring secure and efficient data management throughout the app.
